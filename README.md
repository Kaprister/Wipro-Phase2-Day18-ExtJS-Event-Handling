Overview

This project demonstrates various event-handling techniques using EXT JS. It covers handling user interactions such as button clicks, form submissions, keyboard events, mouse events, and more. The implementation ensures efficient event management using event delegation and optimized event listeners.

Features

Button Click Handling: Alerts the user when a button is clicked.

Form Submission: Prevents default submission and captures the entered name.

Event Delegation: Handles click events dynamically for child buttons inside a parent div.

Double Click Event: Changes text color on double-click.

Mouse Events: Background color changes on hover and right-click is disabled in a section.

Keyboard Events: Detects key presses, keydown, and changes in the input field.

Focus & Blur Events: Applies styling changes on input and submit button focus/blur.

Window Resize Event: Logs the window's new width upon resizing.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the webpage.

EXT JS: JavaScript framework used for event handling.

CSS (Inline): Basic styling for elements.

How It Works

Event Listeners: Various elements such as buttons, input fields, and the document listen for different events.

Event Delegation: Click events are handled dynamically for child buttons inside a parent container.

Form Handling: Prevents default form submission and captures input data.

Keyboard & Mouse Events: Detects key presses, changes input values, and modifies element styles based on user interactions.

Window Events: Detects and logs window resize actions.
