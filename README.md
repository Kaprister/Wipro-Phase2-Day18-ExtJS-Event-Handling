# EXT JS Event Handling 

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates various *event-handling* techniques using *EXT JS. It covers handling **user interactions* such as:
- Button clicks
- Form submissions
- Keyboard events
- Mouse events
- Window resizing 

The implementation ensures *efficient event management* using *event delegation* and optimized event listeners.

## 🚀 Features

✅ *Button Click Handling:* Alerts the user when a button is clicked.  
✅ *Form Submission:* Prevents default submission and captures the entered name.  
✅ *Event Delegation:* Handles click events dynamically for child buttons inside a parent div.  
✅ *Double Click Event:* Changes text color on double-click.  
✅ *Mouse Events:* Background color changes on hover, and right-click is disabled in a section.  
✅ *Keyboard Events:* Detects key presses, keydown, and changes in the input field.  
✅ *Focus & Blur Events:* Applies styling changes on input and submit button focus/blur.  
✅ *Window Resize Event:* Logs the window's new width upon resizing.

## 🔍 How It Works

📌 *Event Listeners* → Various elements (buttons, input fields, etc.) listen for different events.  
📌 *Event Delegation* → Click events are handled dynamically for child buttons inside a parent container.  
📌 *Form Handling* → Prevents default form submission and captures input data.  
📌 *Keyboard & Mouse Events* → Detects key presses, changes input values, and modifies styles based on user interactions.  
📌 *Window Events* → Detects and logs window resize actions.
